// Projects the kit's skills, shared instructions and agents into the layouts Codex reads.
//
// `<plugin-root>/skills/`, `<plugin-root>/instructions/` and `<plugin-root>/agents/` are the
// SOURCE OF TRUTH and are never modified. This module reads them and writes `.agents/` and
// `.codex/agents/` into a repository, both gitignored: nothing produced here is a second copy to
// maintain, it is a build output. Delete it and rebuild.
//
// IT LIVES IN THE PLUGIN, NOT IN THE REPOSITORY, AND THAT IS THE POINT. Until 21 September 2026 it
// was `scripts/build-codex.mjs` — and `scripts/` is repository-only: the plugin cache mirrors
// `galy/` alone, so the file a client needed was in the one folder their installation never
// receives. The generator had been taught to run from a host repository (`--plugin-root`,
// `--repo-root`) and still could not be reached by anyone who had not cloned this repository. A
// command nobody can type is the same defect as a path that resolves to nothing, one floor up.
//
// So the implementation ships, as a subcommand of the CLI that already ships:
//
//   cs codex                              # from the client's own repository
//   node scripts/build-codex.mjs          # from a checkout of this repository, unchanged
//
// There is ONE implementation. `scripts/build-codex.mjs` is a caller that supplies this
// repository's own defaults and nothing else — not a copy, and not a copy made at build time,
// which would go stale in silence.
//
// IT READS ONE ROOT AND WRITES ANOTHER, AND THE TWO ARE NAMED SEPARATELY. Until 21 September 2026
// both hung off the script's own location: the sources were `<script>/../galy`, the output
// `<script>/..`, and the projection could therefore only ever be built inside this repository. That
// is the wrong place for it. The kit is INSTALLED into a client's machine and their code lives
// somewhere else entirely, so a Codex tab in their repository saw no `cs:*` skill and never had —
// their own generator projects their `.claude/` and knows nothing of the kit. The two flags below
// say where to read and where to write, and they are separate because those are separate machines'
// worth of distance.
//
//   --plugin-root <dir>   the installed kit — the folder holding `skills/`, `instructions/` and
//                         `agents/`. It is exactly what `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` names, so inside a
//                         skill it is `"$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT"` verbatim, and outside one it is
//                         `~/.claude/plugins/cache/castalie/cs/<version>`.
//                         Default: this file's own plugin root — `bin/..`, which is the installed
//                         kit when the CLI runs from the cache, and `galy/` in a checkout of this
//                         repository. So the flag changes nothing when it is absent.
//   --repo-root <dir>     the repository the projection is written into: `.agents/` and `.codex/`
//                         appear at its root, beside that team's code. Default: the working
//                         directory, which is the client's repository when they type `cs codex`.
//
// `scripts/build-codex.mjs` overrides both defaults with this repository's own, so the bare
// `node scripts/build-codex.mjs` is unchanged, here and only here.
//
// THE TRANSFORMATION IS MECHANICAL. No sentence is rewritten, reworded or summarised — published
// measurements put model-authored instruction files at -20% success rate and +20% inference cost,
// so the body markdown is copied byte for byte. The only thing added is a preamble, above the
// original text, that never touches it.
//
//   <plugin-root>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md  ->  .agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md
//   <plugin-root>/instructions/<name>.md  ->  .agents/instructions/<name>.md
//   <plugin-root>/agents/<name>.md        ->  .codex/agents/<name>.toml
//
// `.agents/` IS THE PLUGIN ROOT UNDER CODEX, and that is why the mapping above keeps the source's
// shape one level down instead of flattening it. A skill body spells its shared conventions
// `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/instructions/<file>.md`; under Claude Code that variable is the installed
// plugin's folder, which is `galy/` here. Reproduce that layout under `.agents/` and the same
// relative path resolves on both sides, with nothing rewritten inside the body.
//
// Until 21 September 2026 only the skills were projected. Eighteen references across nine skills
// and one agent therefore resolved to nothing under Codex — a tab running `feature-implement` was
// told to read its acceptance criteria from a path that did not exist, and went on without them
// while every check stayed green. The table below even declared the gap, pointing at
// `.agents/skills/`, which held no such file either: a degradation nobody can act on reads as a
// bug. `assertReferencesResolve` below is what keeps that shut — every `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/…`
// path the produced files spell must exist in the tree that produced them, and CI replays it.
//
// CAPABILITIES CODEX LACKS ARE DECLARED, NEVER SILENTLY DROPPED. Substituting tool names inside
// the prose would corrupt code fences, tables and examples — and would be a rewrite. So each
// generated file carries a preamble listing the proprietary capabilities its body mentions and
// what a Codex session should do instead. The reader sees the gap; the text stays intact.
//
// This exists because the kit claims to be harness-neutral, and a claim nobody exercises is a
// wish. The product already holds that line and tests it: MaturityCatalog carries no vendor name,
// so a client who changes harness keeps their score. This script is the same promise, kept on the
// side the client actually installs.
//
// Usage:
//   cs codex                                # write the projection into the working directory
//   cs codex --verify                       # build into a temp tree, assert every reference resolves
//   cs codex --check                        # --verify, plus drift against the projection on disk
//   cs codex --quiet                        # only the summary line
//   cs codex --repo-root <dir>              # write somewhere other than the working directory
//
// `--check` presumes a built projection on disk and is therefore a DEVELOPER's check, not CI's: the
// output is gitignored, so a fresh checkout has none and every file reads as drift. CI runs
// `--verify`, which needs nothing but the sources.
