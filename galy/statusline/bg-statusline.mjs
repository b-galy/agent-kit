// bg-statusline — what this working copy has in hand, on the row under the prompt.
//
// Prints one line naming the work THIS working copy has in hand — the objective, the
// brief and the spec, by their names, each one a clickable link into the workspace that
// owns it. Nothing here is specific to one workspace: the address, the credentials and
// the links are resolved from the working copy's own configuration, so the same script
// serves every workspace that speaks the Galy tool contract.
//
// What the row is NOT, and used to be: the workspace's queue — every spec in progress
// and every brief cleared for a spec. On a workstation running ten worktrees that row
// was the same in all ten, and it was already full before any work had started. It
// answered a question nobody had asked, in the one place where the answer to "what am
// I on?" belongs, which is worse than answering nothing: a queue read as a working
// copy's own work is read wrong every time.
//
// Nor is it a list of numbers. A row that says "spec 365 · brief 233" tells nobody what
// they are on: the name is the thing, and the number is only where the link goes. So the
// row names ONE piece of work — the spec picked up last, the brief it belongs to and the
// objective that brief serves — and counts the rest.
//
// What a copy holds is not deduced here: `hooks/bg-work.mjs` writes it beside the code,
// from the claims and the writes the session actually makes. Without that hook the row
// stays empty, which is the right way for it to be wrong.
//
//   node bg-statusline.mjs             render (reads a cache, never the network)
//   node bg-statusline.mjs --install   wire it into the harness, keeping any status line already there
//   node bg-statusline.mjs --uninstall put back what was there before
//   node bg-statusline.mjs --refresh   fill the cache (what a render schedules, detached)
//
// Why the cache. A status line runs on a 300ms debounce, and a workstation
// running ten sessions runs ten of them. The quota that would break first is per
// address, not per session — so the render path never speaks to the network, and
// one detached refresh per TTL serves every session on the machine. The stamp is
// claimed BEFORE the refresh is spawned: nine sessions then skip instead of
// piling onto the same address at the same instant.
//
// What it holds is the workspace's NAMES, keyed by id, one file per workspace. The row
// differs from one working copy to the next; the names do not. A refresh asks the
// workspace for the ids this copy holds and nothing more — three reads for one spec —
// never for the whole catalog: a workspace with two thousand specs answers three reads
// in the time it would take to page through the first hundred.
