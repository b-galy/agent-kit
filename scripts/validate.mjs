// What must stay true of this repository, checked on every push.
//
// The invariants, each one written the day it was broken.
//
// The kit's first name is written `{first}` in these comments: the repository never spells it
// whole, and invariant 6 is what keeps it that way. `FIRST` below assembles it from two halves.
//
//   1. THE SKILL FORMAT. `SKILL.md` is an open specification with two mandatory fields, `name`
//      and `description`, and that is what makes these files readable without retouching by
//      Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini CLI and goose — the agents our clients
//      already run. A skill that drifts out of the format does not fail loudly: it is simply
//      never picked up, in exactly one of those agents, and nobody finds out.
//
//   2. NO INSTANCE ADDRESS. Castalie is multi-tenant and every workspace answers on its own host;
//      a dedicated instance does not even answer on ours. The published artefact therefore says
//      WHAT to do and never WHERE: the address travels with the token, on the developer's own
//      machine. A hardcoded host does not fail loudly either — it authenticates nobody and
//      reads as a bad token.
//
//   2b. NO EXAMPLE ADDRESS ON A DOMAIN WE ARE GIVING UP. The workspaces moved to `castalie.app`,
//      and the `{first}.cloud` and `{first}.io` domains are to be deleted. Until they are, a stale
//      example redirects and reads as a typo; after, it resolves to nothing and reads as an
//      instruction — and the costliest place for one is `connect`, whose address is the very
//      first thing a customer types. Only an address in a URL is matched, so the production-host
//      guard in the bug-evaluation runner keeps the bare hostname it needs in order to go on
//      recognising an instance still answering there. That entry comes out with the domains.
//
//   3. NO STALE REPOSITORY NAME. This repository has moved three times: `claude-kit` became
//      `agent-kit`, then the organisation `{first}-io` became `b-{first}` when the brand changed,
//      then `b-{first}` became `castalie-app` when the product became Castalie. GitHub redirects
//      every one of those old addresses, which is exactly what makes them dangerous: everything
//      keeps working, so nobody aligns anything, and a redirect breaks the day someone creates a
//      repository under the freed name. A freed organisation survives only as an empty
//      placeholder holding its redirect — a courtesy, never an address to publish.
//
//      So the former names are a LIST, below, and adding the next one is adding a string to it.
//      They were an alternation inside two regular expressions until 22 September 2026, and the
//      third rename is what showed the cost: to add a name you had first to read a pattern, work
//      out which half of it was the organisation and which the repository, and edit both. A check
//      nobody can extend without decoding it is a check that stops being extended.
//
//   4. NO COMMAND THAT DOES NOT EXIST. `npx {first}-setup` was distributed by the `connect` skill
//      while the package was published on no registry: npm answered `E404 Not Found`, and the
//      first developer to type it concluded the product did not exist. It had already been
//      corrected on the screen — and stayed wrong here, which is precisely what a check is for.
//
//   5. NO STALE NAMESPACE. The plugin was renamed from `{first}` to `bg` when the brand changed,
//      then from `bg` to `cs` when the product became Castalie.
//
//      IT WAS ONE NAME FOR EVERYTHING UNTIL 22 SEPTEMBER 2026, AND IT IS NOW TWO — on purpose.
//      The plugin stays `cs`, because its name is what a person TYPES, dozens of times a day, as
//      `/cs:<skill>`. The MCP server is registered as `castalie`, because its alias is what a
//      person READS — in `claude mcp list`, and in every tool name `mcp__castalie__<tool>` — and
//      what is read should be the product's name rather than an abbreviation of it. The CLI `cs`
//      and its folder `.cs/` follow the command, not the server. The marketplace is `castalie`,
//      so the plugin installs as `cs@castalie`; the packages are `@castalie/*`.
//
//      So "one namespace" stops being the rule here, and the rule that replaces it is: a name that
//      is typed stays short, a name that is read says what the product is called. Anyone tempted
//      to align the two again should know it was tried that way first.
//
//      None of the old names fails loudly. A skill that still says `{first}:adapt` or `bg:adapt`
//      gets `plugin-not-found`, which reads as a broken installation rather than a stale line; a
//      skill that names `mcp__cs__whoami` sends the agent after a tool nobody serves, in front of
//      a user, mid-ritual; `cs@b-{first}` names a marketplace a fresh workstation does not have, and
//      on an old one reinstalls from a cache that no longer follows this repository.
//
//      What does NOT move, and is therefore not matched: the `renames` mapping that carries the
//      plugin renames, the config folder's former names `.bg/` and `.{first}/` — read as fallbacks
//      so nobody loses a token — the `{FIRST}_*` environment variables read after `CASTALIE_*`, the
//      legacy managed-block markers under the `{first}:` prefix that skills still READ because
//      customers' files carry them — the kit WRITES `castalie:*` since 1.17.0 — and the REMOVAL of
//      a former marketplace, which is exactly what setup and the README tell a workstation to do.
//      Since 1.18.0 every one of them is assembled from `FIRST` rather than spelled (invariant 6).
//
//      The repository moved too, on 22 September 2026: it is `castalie-app/agent-kit`. It was the
//      one name here nobody could change from a branch — a GitHub organisation is renamed from the
//      web interface by its owner — so it had been reduced to a single constant beforehand,
//      `REPOSITORY` in setup/setup.mjs, precisely so that the day would cost one line and five of
//      prose. It did.
//
//      And the MARKETPLACE is `castalie`, not `castalie-app`. Not a leftover: a marketplace is
//      named by this repository's own manifest, never by its owner — on 3 September 2026 the
//      marketplace was `{first}` while the organisation was already `b-{first}`, which is what proves
//      it. An installed workstation keys its plugin cache by that name, so renaming it to follow
//      an organisation would cost every one of them a migration for a spelling nobody types.
//
//   6. THE RETIRED NAME IS NOT SPELLED. On 25 September 2026 Benoît, watching a session edit
//      `{first}/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, said the name should no longer appear — and it still
//      named the plugin's folder, 31 files and 97 paths, a year after the brand had moved on. So a
//      case-insensitive search for it, over every path and every file, returns his own name and
//      nothing else. What must still be READ under it (the fallbacks listed in 5) is assembled
//      from two halves, `"g" + "aly"`, with a one-line comment where it is. The single exception is
//      the `renames` key in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`: Claude Code follows that chain from
//      the oldest name, the docs ask for it to be kept as append-only history, and a JSON key
//      cannot be assembled.
//
// Exit code 0 = every invariant holds, 1 = at least one does not.
