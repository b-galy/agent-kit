// check-statusline — the row names this working copy's work, by its names, and nothing else.
//
// It exists because of the failures it replays. The row used to name the workspace's
// queue, so a workstation running twenty worktrees showed the same three specs in all
// twenty, and showed them before any work had started. Then it named numbers, and a row
// that reads "spec 365 · brief 233" tells nobody what they are on. Every assertion below
// is one sentence of that: nothing claimed shows nothing, two copies show two rows, one
// spec is named with its brief and its objective, an `id` that belongs to a phase never
// lands on a spec, a workspace that spells the field `specId` is heard as well as one that
// spells it `id`, and what a session took in hand is that session's: a new one on the same
// copy starts on an empty row rather than yesterday's spec, the same one resumed finds its
// work again, and a process dying late never wipes what a live session has just claimed.
//
//   node scripts/check-statusline.mjs
//
// It speaks to no network: the catalog of names is written by hand, and the whole run
// happens in a scratch folder that TEMP is pointed at, so a developer's own row and
// cache are never touched.
